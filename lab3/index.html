		<h2>Chapter 1: In the Beginning</h2>
		<img src="chapter1.jfif" alt="Kid on Computer">
		<p>In the beginning, John had never heard of programming. In fact, he did 
		   not even know what a computer was. His parents had an office computer 
		   and his interest in technology was sparked. But he had already set his 
		   mind on becoming a teacher just the same as his parents and grandma and 
		   grandpa. Should he become a computer teacher?</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Chapter 2: What Now</h2>
		<img src="chapter2.jfif" alt="Black Hat Hacker">
		<p>John had a choice to make. He could combine both and become a teacher, or
		he could focus on one or another. Throughout high school, he debated this 
		back and forth. Then, one day, his high school was hacked and valuable 
		information was stolen. John knew what he wanted to be.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Chapter 3: We're Saved</h2>
		<img src="chpater3.jfif" alt="Superhero Hacker Text">
		<p>He didn't want any school to be hacked again. So he decided he wanted to
		become a computer scientist and become a hero for everyone by saving every 
		school from being hacked. In just his first year in college, he made an 
		unhackable security system, and no school was ever hacked again.</p>
